  <b> Amazon India Pvt. Ltd – Earning Sources & Tax Analysis</b><br><br>

---

##  **Project Overview**

This project analyzes **Amazon India Pvt. Ltd’s multiple revenue streams** and the **impact of taxation** on its overall profitability.  
The goal is to understand how Amazon earns from two major sources:

1️. **Direct Product Sales**  
2️. **Referral (Commission) Income** from third-party sellers  

The analysis covers **four key cities** — *Mumbai, Delhi, Bangalore,* and *Chennai* — revealing trends in sales, commissions, taxes, and product-level profitability.  
It combines **SQL**, **Python**, and **Power BI** to create a complete financial performance dashboard.
